        <p class="text1"> The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, is known as a 'witcher'. A witcher is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical condtioning and deadly genetic mutations, all with the aim of constructing and equipping a person to become a dexterous 'monster slayer for hire'.

        <h2><span>Good vs Evil</span></h2> 
        <p class="text4"> In the witcher universe, monsters are seen by humans as the ultimate 'evil'. However, as one progresses through the story, we see that some monsters appear to have more 'humanity' than some humans. The story allows for such moral complexity,  frequently leaving the player to reflect on their own ideas of 'good and 'evil.<br><br>

        Although Geralt is a monster slayer, frequently hired by humans, he is often ostracized by the human society for his apparent 'differences'. And, because Geralt is a monster slayer, he is also neglected by the more intelligent members of the monster community. This unfortunate circumstance often leaves Geralt alienated from most beings.
