# Fan-themed Website for The 'WITCHER 3 VIDEO GAME'
The website is a 'fan-site' dedicated to the over whelmingly successful video game: The witcher 3.

### IMPORTANT!
This is my first ever attempt of making a website. Therefore, there is limited functionality and the subsidary pages are severley lacking content.

# Things that I would implement going forward:
1. Web site responsiveness - For now the website is static, therefore looks god-awful on the mobile version.  
2. More detailed site pages - For now the the secondary web pages are severley lacking content.
