# Website

### IMPORTANT - The page is not responsive, therefore it is best viewed on a desktop.
This is my first ever attempt at making a website. Therefore, there is limited functionality and the subsidiary pages are severley lacking content.

# Things that I would implement going forward:
1. Web site responsiveness - For now the website is static, therefore looks god-awful on the mobile version.  
2. More detailed site pages - For now the the secondary web pages are severley lacking content.
