# Website - last edited in Feb 2022.

### IMPORTANT - The page is not responsive, therefore it is best viewed on a desktop.
This is my first ever attempt at making a website. Therefore, there is limited functionality and the subsidiary pages are severley lacking content. - I'm really selling this well aren't I? :D

# Things that I would implement going forward:
1. Web site responsiveness - For now, the website is static. Therefore, it looks god-awful on any device that does not have a wide screen.
2. More detailed site pages - For now, the secondary web pages are severley lacking content.
3. Use of semantic HTML to eradicate the current headache inducing use of a div soup.
